# **Project Management**  

## **1. Introduction**  
This course provides an introduction to project management, covering essential concepts and tools for managing complex projects. Special emphasis is given to managing software development projects and ensuring software quality.  

> *Everything you ever wanted to know about how to get things done!*  

## **2. Motivations**  
Most Computer Science & Engineering courses focus on:  
- Technical aspects of software development (e.g., testing, writing requirements, modeling systems)  
- Notations (e.g., UML, Java)  

However, building high-quality software requires a well-defined and managed process.  

### **2.1. Why Project Management Matters?**  
- **Testing Techniques Are Useless Without Time:** If a project is poorly planned and runs late, testing may be skipped.  
- **Good Requirements Need a Controlled Process:** Without a structured process, requirement changes and revisions become chaotic.  
- **Quality Software Needs Process Management:** Delivering software on time and within budget is impossible without proper project management.  

## **3. Who Needs Software?**  
Most software is developed for organizations and users with specific needs.  

- **Stakeholders:** Anyone with an interest in the software being developed.  
- **Users:** Those who will use the software for specific tasks.  
- **Stakeholders vs. Users:** Sometimes stakeholders are also users, but often, they are not.  
  - *Example:* A CEO may have a stake in software development but may never use the software personally.  

## **4. Who Builds Software?**  
Software is typically built by a team of professionals, including:  

- **Requirements Analysts (RAs):** Communicate with users and stakeholders, define behavior, and write software requirements.  
- **Architects:** Plan the technical solution.  
- **Developers:** Write the code.  
- **Testers:** Ensure the software meets requirements and functions correctly.  
- **Support Team:** Handles installation, training, and maintenance.  

## **5. What is a Project?**  
A project is a **temporary** endeavor undertaken to create a **unique** product, service, or result.  

### **5.1. Characteristics of a Project**  
- **Temporary:**  
  - Has a definite start and end (either upon completion or closure).  
  - The results, however, may not be temporary (e.g., a product lifecycle).  
- **Unique Output:**  
  - A **product** (e.g., a software component).  
  - A **service capability** (e.g., a business function).  
  - A **result** (e.g., research findings documented in reports).  
- **Progressive Elaboration:**  
  - Developed in steps and increments.  

## **6. Project vs. Operational Work**  
Work can be categorized as either **Project Work** or **Operational Work**.  

### **6.1. Common Characteristics**  
- Performed by people.  
- Limited resources.  
- Planned, executed, and controlled.  

### **6.2. Differences**  
| Feature | Project Work | Operational Work |  
|---------|-------------|-----------------|  
| **Goal** | Achieve specific objectives and then terminate | Sustain ongoing business operations |  
| **Duration** | Temporary | Continuous |  

## **7. Examples**  

| Task | Type |  
|------|------|  
| Cooking dinner | Operational Work (OW) |  
| Preparing a dinner for friends | Project (PR) |  
| Mass producing a car | Operational Work (OW) |  
| Designing a new car model | Project (PR) |  
| Publishing research papers | Operational Work (OW) |  
| Developing a software system | Project (PR) |

# **Laws of Project Management**  
- Projects often appear **90% complete for an extended period** due to unforeseen challenges.  
- **Murphy’s Law applies**: When things seem to be going well, something might go wrong.  
- If project content changes frequently, **the rate of change often exceeds the rate of progress**.  
- Project teams often **resist progress reporting**, as it highlights slow progress.
